// This is the first time making a java program
// File name: helloworld.java

// Your program begins with a call to main{}
    // Public = visibility of function (can also be private, only accessable inside the class)
    // Public functions can be called outside the class
    // Static =  function cannot be changed
    // Void = when you don't return something
    // Main = first function HAS to be the main function, main logic in main function
    // String = it can take in a string args
        // args =  arguments, string is the type it is. casting args as a string to tell
            // what the type is
    // System = libray, same with out, and print is the function. println = print line

// Declaring the class as HelloWorld (name of the file)
class HelloWorld{

    // Declaring the peramaters of the main function, public, static, void refers to not expecting a return
    public static void main(String args[]){
        // printing Hello World
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
